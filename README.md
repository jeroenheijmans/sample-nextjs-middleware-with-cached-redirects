# Sample NextJS App with Cached Dynamic Redirects

This application showcases many different ways to handle redirects in NextJS, including a global cache based middleware solution.

## ⚠️ Notice about updates

Note that this repository is provided "as-is" and will most likely not receive any (security) updates.

## Pages Router

The sample uses the older "Pages" router setup from NextJS.
The reason is simple: the sample was "needed" when researching solutions for a somewhat older production NextJS application that was still on the Pages router.
For the App Router things will possibly work in a similar fashion.
